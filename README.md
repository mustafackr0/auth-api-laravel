# 🔐 Auth API

This is a simple authentication API built with Laravel 11 and Sanctum.

It includes user registration, login, token-based authentication, profile access, and logout functionality.

## 🧪 Postman

You can test all endpoints with the included Postman collection:

📂 `/postman/auth-api.postman_collection.json`

Import it into Postman and set your `{{auth_token}}` variable after login.
